A Human Resource Management System(HRM) has been created using Golang. The system's functionalities primarily focus on Employees, key APIs have been made to Add an Employee, Retrieve Employee details, Update Employee Details and Delete Employee details. The Go web server has been made using `go-fiber` which accesses `mongodb` the database used to store the details of the HRM using APIs.
